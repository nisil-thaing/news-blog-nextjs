  content: '<p>In April 2021, unhappiness among couriers for Shopee Express, the logistics unit of ecommerce player Shopee, regarding the <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-indonesia-denies-claims-underpaid-striking-inhouse-couriers">latest adjustment</a> to their earnings scheme spread onto social media.</p>\n<p>Rian (not his real name), a Shopee Express courier based in South Jakarta, told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that he and his co-workers are now expected to deliver more packages per day – 40 instead of the previous 30 – for the same amount of money. Furthermore, the bonus fee, which couriers earn if they deliver more than the 40 packages, went down roughly by half.</p>\n<div id="attachment_688418" class="wp-caption alignnone">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-688418" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-688418 size-full" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622389639_shopee-express.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="500"><p id="caption-attachment-688418" class="wp-caption-text">A tale of two posters: “We stock up on your needs for you” (left) and “You #shopfromhome for Indonesia” (right) / Photo credit: Shopee</p>\n</div>\n<p>With the current scheme, Rian calculated that he can only take home a maximum of 130,000 rupiah (US$9) per day, which is about 30% lower than what he was earning before. Even if he works 30 days a month, his earnings still would not meet <a href="https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/indonesias-2021-minimum-wage-no-increases-for-most-provinces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jakarta’s minimum wage</a>, which is set at around 4.4 million rupiah (US$312).</p>\n<p>The latest outburst is <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/grab-gojek-drivers-considered-employees-contractors">another flashpoint</a> involving contract workers and the powerful tech giants that they slog for. Internet companies walk a fine line between keeping costs low and sustainable and ensuring that these workers are incentivized enough to take on more jobs.</p>\n<p>Like ride-hailing drivers, most Shopee Express couriers are considered independent contractors. As such, their wages are considered variable costs, which are typically the starting point of a cost-cutting measure among businesses.</p>\n<p>This conflict also comes at a time when Southeast Asia’s logistics companies – some of which have become unicorns while raising mega rounds – are on course for a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/indonesias-ecommerce-logistics-giants-brace-price-war">price war</a>.</p>\n<h2>Earning above the norm</h2>\n<p>Responding to worker discontent, Handika Jahja, Shopee Indonesia’s executive director, told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in a previous interview that even with the adjustments, the company’s rates are still higher than the market average.</p>\n<p>He also <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-indonesia-denies-claims-underpaid-striking-inhouse-couriers">denied</a> reports that Shopee Indonesia’s couriers went on strike. Furthermore, even if there were couriers who did not come to work, Jahja said it was only fair since they are not considered <a href="https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-5541576/penjelasan-bos-shopee-soal-penyesuaian-upah-kurir-yang-sempat-heboh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">employees</a> of the company. “Under the partnership terms, the courier can choose whether to come to work or not,” he added.</p>\n<p>Jahja also stated that couriers can collect 2,200 rupiah (US$0.15) per package if they deliver more than 80 per day. But according to Rian, delivering 80 packages daily is not realistic. The Shopee Express courier noted that it really depends on the number of packages available on that day as well as how many workers are allocated to each shift.</p>\n<p>The seniority of couriers is also a factor. Rian said the senior ones can choose small packages and short delivery distances, so they can carry more packages in a day compared to their more junior counterparts. Beginner couriers often get the “leftover” packages, which are usually larger-sized and have lengthier delivery distances.</p>\n<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 250px;" title="Interactive or visual content" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6234492/embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>“If the weather is good, we can finish sending 80 packages by 5 p.m. But sometimes there are only 40 packages, so it’s not certain,” shares Rian.</p>\n<p>Outside Jakarta, it’s a different story. To Firman (not his real name), a Shopee Express courier in the Central Java province, getting 80 packages per day is almost impossible. On an average day, he typically delivers a dozen packages.</p>\n<p>In addition, the delivery distance is relatively farther, as the delivery area covers two subdistricts. The situation is different in Jakarta, where Shopee warehouses are spread over many points, so couriers can focus on serving only one subdistrict.</p>\n<h2>Lessons from older players</h2>\n<p>As other logistics players have shown, paying couriers higher wages is actually not impossible.</p>\n<p>Based on numbers from a courier who works for Lazada’s LEL Express, he earns more per package compared to a Shopee Indonesia courier. Apart from that, he also gets a daily allowance for gas and parking. Meanwhile, Rian said that Shopee Express couriers pay for these expenses out of their own pocket.</p>\n<p>That said, the Lazada courier revealed that even though he typically delivers 60 to 100 packages in a day, he doesn’t have definite working hours or days. Sometimes, couriers are not called in if there are too few packages to deliver, though he would get the call at least three days a week.</p>\n<div id="attachment_683530" class="wp-caption alignnone">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-683530" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-683530 size-large" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JT-Express_2-750x500.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="500"><p id="caption-attachment-683530" class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: J&amp;T Express</p>\n</div>\n<p>The conditions are even better for a courier at JNE, one of the older third-party logistics players in Indonesia. A JNE courier based in Karawang, a town east of Jakarta, told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that he works under a fixed-time employment agreement. Every month, he receives a basic salary, phone credit, and gasoline allowances as well as attendance and service fees.</p>\n<p>He also gets a bonus and holiday allowance every year, and enjoys certain benefits as JNE is registered with BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, a government entity that manages social security for workers.</p>\n<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" title="Interactive or visual content" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6234233/embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<div style="width: 100%!; margin-top: 4px!important; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" style="text-decoration: none!important;" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6234233/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/6234233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important; border: none!important; margin: 0!important;" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" alt="Made with Flourish"></a></div>\n<p>While the amounts may vary between branches, the JNE courier says that his gross income, including costs for gasoline and parking, could be over 5 million rupiah (US$346.52) per month. That amount exceeds the minimum wage in both Karawang and Jakarta, unlike what Rian earns at Shopee.</p>\n<p>Roni (not his real name), a logistics worker for competitor J&amp;T Express in the Jakarta suburb of Depok, said that he has a similar compensation plan. In contrast, while Shopee Express couriers receive above average incentives per package, being contractual partners means that they don’t receive a basic salary.</p>\n<p>The sources also shared that similar to Shopee Express, JNE and J&amp;T actually have freelance couriers with partner status. But they observe that freelance couriers only come in during high-volume seasons, such as the holidays or ecommerce promotional campaigns.</p>\n<h2>A fairer and more efficient system</h2>\n<p>Rian said that some of his colleagues who objected to the fee reduction decided to stop being courier partners and look for other jobs. But Rian decided to stay, and both he and fellow courier Firman hope that they will be <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/grab-gojek-drivers-considered-employees-contractors">upgraded</a> from Shopee Express partners to full-time employees.</p>\n<p>In an article titled <a href="https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/3887/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">“The Injuries of Platform Logistics,”</a> researcher David Hill discusses the impact of Amazon’s marketplace and logistics business on people, including material losses, social costs, and psychological damage.</p>\n<p>Recruiting contractual “partners” instead of full-time employees is a scheme that has <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/grab-gojek-drivers-considered-employees-contractors">primarily emerged</a> from the startup world. This approach converts fixed costs – as in the salaries of full-time employees – into variable costs, which provides more flexibility.</p>\n<p>“The result is lower wages, lower quality of workers (deskilling), and an increase in the intensity of the monotonous work imposed on freelancers,” wrote Hill.</p>\n<div id="attachment_682324" class="wp-caption alignnone">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-682324" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-682324 size-large" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shopee-Express-courier-750x563.png" alt="" width="750" height="563"><p id="caption-attachment-682324" class="wp-caption-text">A courier holds up a sign that says, “We send good to you, you #shopfromhome for Indonesia.” / Photo credit: Shopee</p>\n</div>\n<p>Firman believes that it’s financially viable for Shopee to hire full-time delivery workers. That’s because its logistical operations are closely intertwined with its core ecommerce business.</p>\n<p>Dedicated ecommerce logistics companies like Singapore-based Ninja Van employ a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/ninja-van-powering-crossborder-ecommerce-deliveries">large pool of full-time workers</a>. It does this out of necessity because logistics operations need to be hyper-efficient, which is hard to achieve with freelance or part-time couriers.</p>\n<p>Apart from better wages, Rian also wants a fairer and more organized work distribution system for couriers.</p>\n<p>Rian recalled a time when he was only able to take three packages for one trip because they were larger-sized. That meant returning to the warehouse to get more packages, which was a “waste of time.”</p>\n<blockquote class="pull-quote">A business like Shopee also exists because we send the goods. It’s not just about the online platform and promos.</blockquote>\n<p>“Meanwhile, other [couriers] were able to carry many more packages at once,” he added.</p>\n<p>When contacted by <em>Tech in Asia</em>, Shopee Indonesia explained that it is possible to convert Shopee Express couriers from partners to employees. In fact, Jahja said that the company has already done this to an extent.</p>\n<p>However, Shopee Indonesia did not specify how many of its couriers are currently partners nor did it spell out how couriers can become employees.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was <a href="https://id.techinasia.com/masalah-dan-peluang-mogok-kerja-mitra-kurir-shopee-express">originally published</a> on Tech in Asia Indonesia.</em></p>\n<p class="p1"><i>Currency converted from Indonesian rupiah to US dollar: US$1 = 14.272,50 rupiah.</i></p>',

  content: '<p>Singapore-headquartered property startup 99 Group has doubled its sales bookings in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic, a source familiar with the firm tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. It is in advanced discussions to secure funding that will fuel its expansion beyond Singapore and Indonesia.</p>\n<p>Part of this proposed deal would involve an investor buying out Australian property firm REA’s 27% stake in 99 Group, along with pumping in fresh expansion capital. This move would free up 99 Group to pursue its aggressive growth plans, <em>Tech in Asia</em> understands.</p>\n<p>In a <a href="https://rea3.irmau.com/site/PDF/aeab22b6-70a0-46f0-a433-3fff3dbd42c0/REAtocombineMalaysiaThailandopswithPropertyGuru" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">public filing</a>, REA confirms that it is looking to divest its interest in 99 Group, and that discussions on the matter are “well progressed.”</p>\n<div id="attachment_688431" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-688431" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-688431" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622428327_with-Google-scaled-1.jpg" alt="99 Group team 99.co" width="2560" height="1920"><p id="caption-attachment-688431" class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: 99 Group</p>\n</div>\n<p>The company is also transitioning from a classifieds model, which some say is on a decline, toward becoming more of a transaction platform. In other words, it seeks to smoothen the entire process of buying and selling properties rather than simply matching property agents with home owners, our source adds. In the automotive industry, <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/fastgrowing-carro-profitable-months">Carro</a> and <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/malaysian-car-marketplace-carsome-raises-30m-asia-partners-led-round">Carsome</a> have similarly eschewed the advertising model.</p>\n<p>Property classifieds in Southeast Asia appear to be going through turbulence. 99 Group’s rival PropertyGuru experienced a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/propertygurus-revenue-valuation-fall-time-years">slight dip</a> in revenue and valuation last year. REA, meanwhile, is paring down its involvement in Southeast Asia: It’s in the midst of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-30/propertyguru-to-acquire-rea-group-malaysia-and-thailand-units" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">selling its Malaysia and Thailand units</a> to PropertyGuru.</p>\n<p>Most of 99 Group’s bookings growth comes from its subscription plans with property agents, which allow them to list on its platform. Under accounting rules, the bookings, which are paid upfront, won’t be fully recognized as revenue until the plans, which typically last for 12 months, are used up.</p>\n<p>Our source says that 99 Group doubled its bookings in Q1 2021 compared to the same period last year, while revenue grew by 50%. While some of that growth may have come from its <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/99-set-jv-iproperty-rumah123">joint venture with REA</a>, that only accounts for 10% of it, the source clarifies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See more: <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/property-tech-vietnams-mustwatch-sector">Why property tech is Vietnam’s next must-watch sector</a></strong></p>\n<p>Looking ahead, buying out REA serves 99 Group three purposes: It removes conflict of interest, since REA is forbidden by its shareholder agreement from owning stakes in 99 Group’s competitors, our source explains. It also frees 99 Group to chase aggressive expansion plans that would put profitability in the backseat, which may contradict REA’s need to show a growing bottom line to please public shareholders.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the move would allow 99 Group to expand into Malaysia, which is forbidden in the terms agreed to by both companies. REA could not immediately respond to <em>Tech in Asia’s</em> questions.</p>\n<p>99 Group confirms that it is chasing growth plans that would require venture capital or private equity funding.</p>\n<p>“We have an ambitious plan that requires risk capital and a growth mindset to completely disrupt the market. However, the thing we have learned is that this does not fit well with a public listed company, which needs to focus on quarterly results,” says Darius Cheung, CEO of 99 Group, when asked to comment. “This move allows us to be free from the shackles of having our most significant shareholder being a public company and needing to roll in our numbers into theirs.”</p>\n<p>The startup is aiming to double its revenue annually for the next three years, our source tells us.</p>',

It’s not the first time the crypto market has responded to what enthusiasts call the “China FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).” Chinese regulators have clamped down on cryptocurrencies at least three times since 2013, and Bitcoin prices have crashed and recovered every single time.</p>\n<p>Either way, investing in bitcoins is clearly not for the faint-hearted and certainly not the only way to get into the crypto space. In fact, Bitcoin may not have a great future in the emerging world of blockchain-driven finance.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Released in 2011, Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to emerge and is considered the boomer of all digital assets that now exist in the crypto space. It was originally designed for peer-to-peer payment transactions on a network without the need for intermediaries or regulators.</p>\n<p>This makes it useful as a medium of transaction for illegal dealings on the dark web, although <a href="https://crystalblockchain.com/articles/crystal-blockchain-end-of-year-report-2020" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">research</a> shows that Bitcoin has since gone legit. In 2020, transactions involving darknet entities only accounted for 0.36% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization; privacy-focused Monero has taken over the crypto of choice on the dark web.</p>\n<p>“I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth, nor do I like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air,” said Charlie Munger, vice chairman of US conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/charlie-munger-calls-bitcoin-disgusting-and-contrary-to-the-interests-of-civilization.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent interview</a> with CNBC.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s role in criminal activity is one of the reasons why many old-timers in the traditional finance (TradFi) industry find it objectionable.</p>\n<blockquote class="pull-quote">Many people who own bitcoins now consider it a store of value.</blockquote>\n<p>With the Bitcoin roller coaster now in full swing, detractors and supporters alike are having a field day arguing about whether the bubble has burst, or whether the selldown is merely an aberration in the inevitable rise of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate means of payment.</p>\n<p>One vocal contrarian is Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro. Like other detractors, he maintains that Bitcoin is a Ponzi game because the token’s volatility makes it useless as a medium of exchange. He argues that fundamentally, there is only one way to value bitcoins – buy them in order to sell them at a higher price to someone else. And once Bitcoin enthusiasts stop speculating, the entire scheme collapses.</p>\n<p>Crypto insiders agree that it’s inaccurate to call Bitcoin a cryptocurrency. Many people who own bitcoins now consider it a store of value or as a type of investment security rather than a currency per se.</p>\n<p>They contend that far from being a Ponzi scam, Bitcoin’s status as the OG of cryptocurrencies has allowed it to benefit from a large <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">network effect</a>. That is to say, the more people use bitcoin, the more valuable it becomes as a payment network. (Investment content platform Seeking Alpha has a great <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404419-is-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-point-point-analysis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explanation</a> on why Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.)</p>\n<p>“The term ‘cryptocurrency’ can sometimes mislead some into thinking that these are currencies for payment. With today’s progress of blockchain, cryptocurrencies now cover digital tokens with different functions. ‘Digital assets’ would be more suitable to classify cryptocurrencies,” Xfers executive Sharon Lourdes Paul says in a phone interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>. She’s the head of regional payments for Southeast Asia at the Singapore-based fintech firm, which serves clients including digital asset exchanges.</p>\n<p>“Bitcoin is a store-of-value token. That’s different from a stablecoin that often functions as an e-money with a blockchain ledger, or a governance token that allows owners to vote on protocol matters. When evaluating tokens, we need to first start with knowing what it is used for,” she adds.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, wealth management platform StashAway tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> in an email interview that it sees Bitcoin as high-risk and unstable, so incorporating it into an investment portfolio is best done in small doses. The firm advises investors to limit their crypto allocation to less than 5% of their portfolio. While it doesn’t offer Bitcoin exposure in any of its products or portfolios, it’s studying the feasibility of including digital assets in the longer term.</p>\n<p>“The value of a token relies primarily on the network effect. This core feature makes them inherently volatile. And this volatility is further magnified by the fact that there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there competing for active usage,” observes Stephanie Leung, StashAway’s group deputy chief investment officer.</p>\n<h2>Ether, not Bitcoin, is powering DeFi</h2>\n<p>The technology that underpins Bitcoin and blockchain has spawned an emerging industry that is growing from the bubbling ether of cyberspace. Decentralized finance (DeFi) companies want to replicate the products and services offered by the TradFi industry, such as loans and mortgages, but without the involvement of central banks and regulators.</p>\n<p>One example is Aave, a decentralized platform that allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. Aave runs on Ethereum, an open-source blockchain platform that keeps track of all transactions and changes via smart contracts. Ethereum’s native currency, Ether, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin.</p>\n<div id="attachment_687946" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-687946" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-687946 size-full" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622095131_image-268.png" alt="" width="581" height="503"><p id="caption-attachment-687946" class="wp-caption-text">These NFTs were purchased at US$16.9 million / Photo credit: Larva Labs</p>\n</div>\n<p>By eliminating human intermediaries, DeFi services aim to provide frictionless financial services that are not only faster and available 24/7, but they’re also more transparent, secure, and auditable. Most importantly, the industry seeks to eliminate the barriers to entry for the poor, as no minimum sum would be required for anyone to receive DeFi services.</p>\n<p>DeFi is currently worth between US$60 billion to US$70 billion, according to <a href="https://defipulse.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFi Pulse</a>, which tracks the total value locked in the smart contracts in popular applications and protocols. That may not seem like much compared to the roughly US$700 billion to US$750 billion bitcoin market, but considering DeFi is only four years old, it’s still early days.</p>\n<p>While bitcoins are used mainly for speculative activity, it’s worth noting that since the start of 2020, the amount of ether locked in DeFi protocols has increased by 75% while ether on centralized exchanges has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/almost-twice-as-much-eth-locked-in-defi-as-on-exchanges-glassnode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fallen by 30%</a>. This indicates that more investors are choosing to develop DeFi applications, rather than speculating on the token.</p>\n<p>Aside from DeFi, Ethereum also supports <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56371912" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> or NFTs, which are digital certificates that represent ownership of unique virtual items. By accurately tracking the provenance and subsequent sales activity of an asset like artwork, for example, artists stand to profit each time the item is bought or sold.</p>\n<p>An NFT tagged to a purely digital artwork (in JPG format, no less) by Mike Winkelmann— more popularly known as Beeple—was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sold</a> for US$69 million this year. The gaming industry is also incorporating NFTs, allowing players to sell virtual assets in a game for cryptocurrency, which can then be converted into fiat.</p>\n<div id="attachment_687954" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-687954" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-687954" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622095699_merlin_184196682_72b9e0cc-4062-40bd-9fb3-428d36cf99ab-superJumbo-1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="2048"><p id="caption-attachment-687954" class="wp-caption-text">This NFT by Mike Winkelmann— more popularly known as Beeple—was sold for US$69 million this year. / Image credit: Christie’s</p>\n</div>\n<p>On the other side of the coin are fintech companies that enable TradFi institutions to deploy blockchain technology. This approach is all about modernizing legacy processes and technologies while ensuring compliance with regulators and keeping up with international sustainability standards. In this field, innovation is incremental and risks are carefully weighed before each project goes live.</p>\n<p>Singapore-based Stacs has just completed a proof-of-concept (POC) with Deutsche Bank for the use of private blockchain to manage the interoperability of digital assets across platforms and to improve traceability in sustainability-linked bonds. With greater interoperability, banking customers can expect banking services to be more seamless and integrated even if transactions are conducted across multiple platforms in DeFi and TradFi.</p>\n<p>The Stacs blockchain is integrated with payment modes such as Ubin, an experimental digital currency project led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Diem (formerly known as Libra), a digital currency backed by Facebook.</p>\n<p>This could pave the way for further interoperability between other banks and financial institutions, and eventually, even with DeFi networks.</p>\n<p>“We see the solution as a ‘travel adaptor’ for finance platforms,” says Stacs co-founder and managing director Benjamin Soh. In a Zoom call with <em>Tech in Asia</em>, he also pointed out that the Stacs blockchain is a modified Ethereum blockchain that requires no mining and has a low carbon footprint compared to public blockchains.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of interest among banks to deploy blockchain as the underlying infrastructure for financial services. The POC shows that technologically, it is possible for financial institutions to operate via private blockchain and even build bridges to the DeFi world,” Soh adds.</p>\n<p>Although Stacs is in the blockchain business, it built its reputation as a problem-solver for the TradFi industry and prefers payment the conventional way— with fiat currency. The fintech firm does not accept cryptocurrencies, and raised S$5 million of venture capital in a pre-Series A funding round just <a href="https://stacs.io/singapore-fintech-start-up-stacs-raises-s5-million-in-pre-series-a-funding-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this April</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were pretty set on what we wanted to achieve and didn’t want to issue tokens or speculate in cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we are dealing with regulated financial institutions, so it doesn’t make sense to deal with unregulated currencies. From a company perspective, we also want to support <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DLTs</a> (distributed ledgers) that are more sustainable with less carbon footprint,” explains Soh.</p>\n<h2>A clash between new and old</h2>\n<p>DeFi was built on the dream of a seamless global financial system operating without interference from regulators. But as DeFi matures, pragmatists are waking up to the reality that integrating with the old world may be necessary to achieve mainstream adoption. It’s a stance that goes against the libertarian ethos of crypto pioneers, many of whom remain hopeful that DeFi might one day become more prevalent and take over TradFi.</p>\n<p>The clash of philosophies was evident in an organizational upheaval within MakerDAO, which began operating as a DeFi lending facility in 2017. It is regarded as the first DeFi application to receive significant adoption and runs on the Ethereum blockchain like Aave.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO generates the stablecoin Dai, which is pegged to the US dollar at 1:1. As the term suggests, the stability of Dai enables it to be a medium of exchange for debt repayment, and cross-border exchanges. It is essentially a currency for DeFi services.</p>\n<p>In 2019, MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen reportedly believed it was time to bring the project into the fold of conventional finance and to operate within the confines of government regulations. The internal conflict led to the departure of two MakerDAO executives: chief technology officer Andy Milenius and business development manager Ashleigh Schap.</p>\n<blockquote class="pull-quote">Any international trade is a complex project.</blockquote>\n<p>“The big journey and challenge is how to deliver this vision. It’s quite easy to write a white paper and code, but to get a real live decentralized finance system going, you need to deal with challenges like regulation and how to integrate with the establishment,” said Rune in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-05/crypto-rebels-trip-over-each-other-en-route-to-financial-utopia?sref=UsAjUhBb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Bloomberg</em> interview</a> in 2019.]</p>\n<p>MakerDAO has since taken steps to bridge its world with TradFi. Previously, users could only deposit cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, but today, it can duplicate some of the same services offered by traditional banks, such as issuing loans backed by real-world assets like real estate or cars. The organization’s annual revenue <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-poster-child-makerdaos-annual-revenue-breaks-above-200-million/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">surpassed US$200 million</a> in April after soaring by almost 1,000% since the year started – a testament to MakerDAO’s promise as a cornerstone of the maturing DeFi sector.</p>\n<p>But there could still be some way to go before a seamless financial fabric comprising both TradFi and DeFi becomes a reality. Philosophical differences aside, the operational rules of both worlds will need to be reconciled, and legacy processes in TradFi should be sorted out before integration is possible.</p>\n<p>“Any international trade is a complex project due to the substantial amount of physical paperwork involving the importer, exporter, importer’s bank, exporter’s bank, shipping company, receiving company, local shippers, insurers, and others,” says Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives platform.</p>\n<p>“Because international trade usually involves multiple currencies and jurisdictions, it’s hard to get all parties to agree to settling payments in a cryptocurrency that might not be accepted in any one of the countries that the goods transit through,” he tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<h2>Is there a future for Bitcoin?</h2>\n<p>The world of cryptocurrencies has certainly expanded and matured since Bitcoin first emerged in 2011. Leaving aside nonsense coins like Dogecoin, Potcoin, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blockchain kittens</a>, DeFi transactions can be effectively carried out with stablecoins such as Dai, Tether, and USD Coin while Ether remains the baseline currency for DeFi developers. Central banks are looking to scale the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to incorporate the benefits of blockchain without losing regulatory control.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See more: <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/statebacked-digital-currencies-gamechanger">Are state-backed digital currencies a game-changer?</a></strong></p>\n<p>That the crypto world can now offer many options other than Bitcoin is good news for DeFi in terms of gaining acceptance from TradFi stakeholders. This should be of interest to those who remain unconvinced of the validity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that are not tied to any real-world asset.</p>\n<p>“I am not against the payment network. I am against what is transacted through the DeFi network. [Bernard] Madoff built a massive Ponzi scheme on a perfectly legitimate financial system, and I cannot say the financial system was the problem,” stresses Zhao from Alpine Macro, referring to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">disgraced American fraudster</a> who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bernie-madoff-dead-9d9bd8065708384e0bf0c840bd1ae711" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">died in prison</a> last April.</p>\n<p>He continues: “The DeFi technology may be useful for legitimate digital currency (which is issued by a central bank with an exchange rate to the underlying fiat money at 1:1). The problem is that DeFi is associated with and an integral part of a crypto which is a Ponzi scheme.”</p>\n<p>DeFi startups, however, are more optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It’s likely that bitcoin, like other types of assets like gold, stocks and commodities, will have a role to play alongside all the other types of digital assets,” explains Bybit’s Zhou.</p>\n<p>“In the long run, we definitely believe blockchain technology will rise to the fore because of its inherent advantages and become one of the main technologies underpinning transactions and finance,” he says.</p>\n<div id="attachment_428933" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428933" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-428933" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bitcoin-price-fluctuation.jpg" alt="bitcoin price fluctuation" width="847" height="565"><p id="caption-attachment-428933" class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: <a href="https://www.123rf.com/profile_dimarik16" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dimarik16 / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>The jury’s still out on whether bitcoin is in fact the equivalent of digital gold. Bitcoin’s volatility in recent weeks shows that it is far from being a conservative hedge like gold, which is regarded as a safe haven investment.</p>\n<p>“<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hodl</a>” bitcoin if you have the stomach for it. Having been a core part of crypto history, it could be a great collectible to pass down to your grandchildren.</p>\n<p>For a longer-term strategy, value hunters and enthusiasts may want to look to the other digital assets within the crypto world, especially those that are likely to play a key role in the future of the global financial fabric.</p>',
