Singapore needs to be able to produce a lot more excellent talent across many different sectors,” Park explains.</p>\n<p>DISG’s Ang echoes this sentiment, saying that it’s true that companies find it difficult to hire the right people. However, he notes that this is the case not only for Singapore but also for tech capitals the world over.</p>\n<p>“The good and bad news of it is that there’s not enough people everywhere – even in Silicon Valley they say there’s not enough,” Ang says. “So if there’s not enough anywhere, my job in government is to capture our unfair share.”</p>\n<h2>Attracting talent by attracting businesses</h2>\n<p>Singapore’s connectedness to both developed and emerging economies puts the country in the unique position of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-role-springboard-regional-innovation\">acting as a “launchpad”</a> for multinational corporations (MNCs) seeking to enter Southeast Asia and for regional upstarts looking to access the global market. Ang says that the city-state can capitalize on this to draw more businesses from the regional and global markets.</p>\n<p>“The growth MNCs from the West are looking for isn’t a growth in Singapore per se, but a growth in the region,” he observes.</p>\n<p>Ang cites Google’s <a href=\"https://nextbillionusers.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Next Billion Users</a> initiative as an example of the role that the country can play in the ambitions of MNCs aiming to capture Southeast Asia. The Google project, which is run out of Singapore, plans to create products specifically for emerging markets.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689276\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689276\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-689276\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622711865_GoogleNBU.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-689276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(L-R) Caesar Sengupta, vice president of product management at Google; Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, minister for trade and industry S Iswaran, and Karim Temsamani, president of Google’s APAC operations at the opening of  Google Asia Pacific’s new office at Maple Tree Business City II in 2016. / Photo credit: Koh Mui Fong / Today Online</p>\n</div>\n<p>Despite not having a billion users to offer the US tech giant, Singapore’s value is in its proximity and close ties to the countries within Google’s target market.</p>\n<p>“Singapore is a jumping-off point,” Ang shares. “It’s a listening post for Google to better understand the needs of its next billion users.”</p>\n<p>He adds that similarly, Southeast Asian tech players can treat Singapore as a “stepping stone” for their international endeavors. “It’s precisely because Singapore is English-speaking and cosmopolitan that they feel like it’s a great place to stretch their wings before they take flight into global markets.”</p>\n<p>By attracting businesses from across the world, Singapore is able to create “an interesting blend of East meets West,” forming a pool of global talent to supplement the hiring needs of the growing number of businesses – both local and foreign – setting up in the city-state.</p>\n<p>“We want to connect all these businesses and people together so that they can find partnership, employment, and mentorship opportunities,” says Ang. He points out how this would set the local tech ecosystem flywheel into motion, turning it into “a virtuous cycle of opportunities, attracting talent, which improves the ecosystem, attracting more opportunities, which attracts more talent.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, it’s not enough to “build economic bricks” and let the ecosystem grow on its own. Only when the synergies between local and foreign companies of all sizes are harnessed in complementarity can a tech ecosystem become healthy and vibrant.</p>\n<p>“Singaporeans around the world will start working in the labs of Dell, Google, Facebook, or PayPal, but over time, some of them will naturally osmosize into the local ecosystem,” And explains. “They’ll start their own businesses, join our universities, maybe join the government, and teach us how to better develop policies and regulations around how to fund startups, develop rules around data privacy, and think about digital economy agreements.”</p>\n<h2>Learning from global tech markets</h2>\n<p>To ensure that Singapore remains an attractive place to do business, government agencies like DISG closely follow global innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley, New York, and London. However, Ang stresses that simply copying their policies and strategies wholesale wouldn’t work; instead, it’s vital that the country learns from what these leading tech ecosystems do right and then adapt best practices for the Southeast Asian context.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We want to ensure inclusive, sustainable growth – growth that has a strong sense of social equitability.</blockquote>\n<p>One aspect that the Singapore government has adopted is how Silicon Valley has enabled growth without telling companies how to run their business.</p>\n<p>“We want to be very circumspect about the role of government in developing a tech ecosystem,” says Ang. “Nobody knows better than these companies about the vagaries of their markets and the strategies they need to adopt to win – we can’t advise them on that. The role we want to play is to build a strong set of enablers, whether that’s in making sure that policies are business friendly, looking at tax rates, or looking at the education system.”</p>\n<p>However, he also makes it clear that the answer isn’t letting the tech ecosystem “grow completely laissez-faire.”</p>\n<p>“We can’t have that in Singapore,” Ang says. “We want to ensure inclusive, sustainable growth – growth that has a strong sense of social equitability.”</p>\n<h2>Connecting the world’s tech nodes</h2>\n<p>Though Singapore is dubbed “the region’s tech hub,” Ang says he doesn’t like to use that phrase to describe the city-state.</p>\n<p>“If we want to be a strong tech ecosystem, we need to be connected to other nodes,” he explains. “Our vision for Singapore is to be one of many innovative tech nodes, connected to Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Bangkok, Bali, London, Tel Aviv, and other places that are coming up.”</p>\n<p>This is a necessary endeavor because businesses and individuals “flow from place to place, as and when they need to get the job done,” Ang notes.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t be building up walls or setting ourselves apart from our neighbors,” he concludes. “We need to connect with the region and the world.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Digital Industry Singapore is a joint office of the Economic Development Board, Enterprise Singapore, and Info-communications Media Development Authority.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Digital Industry Singapore on its <a href=\"http://bit.ly/disgctatia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">website</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This content was produced by Tech in Asia Studios, which connects brands with Asia’s tech community. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/advertise\">Learn more</a> about partnering with Tech in Asia Studios.</em></p>",

Many of them are now looking at Southeast Asian tech firms and expect a strong pipeline of deals in series B- and C-stage startups.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689297\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-689297 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622714279_SPAC.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1657\" height=\"462\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-689297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Golden Gate Ventures</p>\n</div>\n<p>That said, even if SPAC mergers have become more common, these do come with a set of risks – an unsuccessful deal will leave an imprint on market sentiment and may negatively impact investor interest or a startup’s momentum.</p>\n<p>Citing a recent EY report, Golden Gate Ventures said that more than half of startup executives from Southeast Asia are looking to actively pursue M&amp;A deals in the next 12 months — the highest number since 2012.</p>\n<p>Although private companies like Grab, Gojek, and Trax have made a number of acquisitions, Golden Gate Ventures anticipates further acquisition deals after these unicorns are publicly listed. This will be spurred on by an increase in liquidity from the stock market.</p>\n<p>According to the report, this liquidity plays a crucial role in providing accessibility for companies to list themselves on Asian exchanges.</p>\n<p>But the financing that startups receive in the stock markets after their IPO is often not a big amount, as retail investors are often “excluded.” That’s why startups have begun turning to dual listings with established exchanges.</p>\n<p>This can be seen with JD.com’s recent listing on the Hong Kong exchange despite it already being listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Southeast Asian companies are opting to list themselves on the NYSE as it allows direct listings with a capital raise (via SPACs), creating an alternate pathway for firms to access the public markets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/leading-asian-tech-players-eyeing-ipo-2021\"><strong>The leading Asian tech players eyeing an IPO in 2021</strong></a></p>\n<p>“[The NYSE is] incredibly bullish on Southeast Asia,” said Delano Musafer, head of Asia-Pacific Capital Markets at NYSE. “For Southeast Asia tech companies, the NYSE is the more proven destination of choice, as evident by the reception of companies like Sea Group. Indeed, we expect to see several IPOs from Southeast Asian startups over the next two years.”</p>",

Some are so immobilized by the fear of failure that they don’t even begin. <em>(As much as I hate to admit it, perfectionism is basically a glorified version of procrastination.)</em></p>\n<p>This is also known as the “perfection paralysis,” and I had struggled with it for as long as I could remember.</p>\n<p>But a few years ago, I stumbled across this quote that completely changed my perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “Done is better than perfect.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This concept is also extremely relevant in the world of startups, where developing a minimum viable product (MVP) is one of the first few crucial steps. In the early stages of a startup, a product doesn’t need to be perfect; it just needs to be good enough to convey an idea with minimal features, so that you can collect feedback and make improvements.</p>\n<p>Building an MVP for a clear and unified audience is fairly straightforward, but what if you’re dealing with a diverse and fragmented market like Southeast Asia? How is it then different from the seemingly one-size-fits-all approach recommended by various online resources?</p>\n<p>If you are looking to break into the Southeast Asian market and have the same question, then we have the <em>perfect</em> event for you. <em>(No pun intended)</em></p>\n<h2>Building an MVP in Southeast Asia</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-687696\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1621952335_image-750x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>Join us on June 10 and learn how to build and launch a MVP in Southeast Asia with Joel Leong, co-founder of ShopBack.</p>\n<p>During the one-hour workshop, you’ll discover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to build an MVP to launch and scale your business in Southeast Asia</li>\n<li>The differences between building an MVP in this unique region and the rest of the world</li>\n<li>Tips and tricks on building an MVP for a fragmented market like Southeast Asia</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About our kickass speaker</h2>\n<p>One of the co-founders of Shopback, Joel Leong currently oversees merchant development and country management. Since its launch in 2014, Shopback has grown to become the leading rewards and discovery platform in Asia Pacific, backed by investors like Temasek, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Rakuten, East Ventures, and others. Shopback has entered a new market every year on average, and it has expanded into nine markets so far, including Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea. For 25 million users, Shopback is their first stop before they do online shopping on Shopee, Lazada, Taobao, iHerb and Nike.</p>\n<h2>Event details</h2>\n<p>We know keynote presentations are a little passe, so we’re all about making our Live events as interactive as possible. That’s why the workshop also includes a Q&amp;A segment where you can ask Joel anything about MVPs and the Southeast Asian market. And you won’t go home empty-handed: You’ll also get a take-home worksheet that provides a step-by-step guide on how you can plan and build your own MVP in the region.</p>\n<p>Date: Thursday, June 10, 2021<br>\nTime: 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. SGT<br>\nVenue: Virtual</p>\n<h2>How can I sign up?</h2>\n<p>As usual, this Live workshop is complimentary for our lovely Tech in Asia Core and Live subscribers.

    "content": "<p>Style Theory, a Singapore-based fashion rental startup backed by SoftBank Ventures Asia, is facing legal action for “continued negligence in completing its obligations” from its Indonesian vendor Beyond or PT Adhikara Bangun Abadi. The maximum estimated value of the contract between both parties is 118.97 billion rupiah (around US$8.3 million), Beyond says in a statement.</p>\n<p>“With a heavy heart,” the vendor says it “has decided to proceed with filing a lawsuit” against Style Theory to ensure that it can fulfill its own obligations to its employees, partners, and shareholders.</p>\n<p>Style Theory tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that it is not in breach of its contract with Beyond. “Regretfully, this intended legal action does not take into account Covid-19 as a Force Majeure as stipulated in the Laundry Service Agreement and the impact the ongoing pandemic has had on many business sectors in Indonesia, including Style Theory,” CEO Chris Halim says.</p>\n<p>He adds that the “maximum estimated value” of the contract is inflated and not based on the actual value.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_639174\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-639174\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-639174\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Style-Theory-Founder-Raena-Lim-Chris-Halim.jpg\" alt=\"Style Theory's co-founders Raena Lim and Chris Halim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-639174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Style Theory’s co-founders, Raena Lim (left) and Chris Halim / Photo credit: Style Theory</p>\n</div>\n<p>Beyond’s representative says that both companies signed the Laundry Service Agreement on July 9, 2020. The vendor had set up a laundry and dry cleaning service for Style Theory, who committed to take up a certain amount of its capacity.</p>\n<p>The partnership was smooth at the start. But since early 2021, Style Theory has “failed to complete the payments due to all outstanding invoices,” the vendor alleges.</p>\n<p>“They say that they need to preserve cash due to the pandemic,” a Beyond representative tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>He explained that Beyond had tried to work out an amicable solution with Style Theory, including letting the startup pay by installment. However, after agreeing to a payment schedule, Style Theory still did not fulfill its obligations. The vendor also tried to adjust the terms and conditions of the service agreement and give a discount, but Style Theory did not respond.</p>\n<p>However, Halim said that his company has been conducting discussions with Beyond in good faith, as they figure out a solution that is fair and equitable to both parties. He added that he is not aware that those negotiations had reached an impasse.</p>\n<p>He also declared that Style Theory has paid Beyond for all laundry and dry cleaning services delivered since the contract began. Nevertheless, the startup remains committed to working with Beyond to reach a fair agreement, Halim said.</p>\n<p>Style Theory was founded by Halim and Raena Lim in 2016 and expanded to Indonesia a year later. Since its inception, the company has raised US$25 million, including a US$15 million series B funding round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia in December 2019. It also counts Alpha JWC Ventures and The Paradise Group among its investors.</p>\n<p>According to data from VentureCap Insights, Style Theory made US$5.5 million and lost US$5.9 million in 2019. At that time, it had more than 200,000 registered users.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6328787/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%!; margin-top: 4px!important; text-align: right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" style=\"text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6328787/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/6328787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img style=\"width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important; border: none!important; margin: 0!important;\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\" alt=\"Made with Flourish\"></a></div>\n<p>Beyond is a company that provides laundry and dry cleaning services to hotels, restaurants, and fashion retailers.

Searches for the brand would similarly increase in both countries for every celebrity engagement, iPrice noted.</p>\n<p>“Surprisingly, the Western celebrity style influence wasn’t as huge in other Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand,” said the report. “For instance, searches reached only over 37,000 in Indonesia, a country with more than 8x Singapore’s Google population.”</p>\n<p>The footwear love continues with Yeezy, which saw a search boost of over 120% in both countries in December 2019, after Kanye West announced his new line of footwear.

Since then, searches blew up by 775% and 542% as of April 2021.</p>\n<p>The higher rate of searches in the studied events are unique to Singapore and the Philippines, according to iPrice, a product meta-search platform for online shoppers in Southeast Asia.</p>",

It’s happened to me several times. You key in an address and count on it to show you the fastest way to your destination – but then you end up walking in circles, trying to figure out where you are and why on earth Google told you to turn left when it seems that you can only go right.</p>\n<p>If it’s frustrating for you and me, imagine what it’s like for companies who are reliant on having accurate map data to make their businesses work. After all, how do you deliver packages efficiently when your drivers can’t figure out where they’re supposed to go? This is a concern especially in many emerging Asian countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, where messy addresses, rural roads, and non-car modes of transportation create a situation where Google Maps may not be very helpful at all.</p>\n<p>Today we look at,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How this startup wants to be <em>the</em> maps provider <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/nextbillionai-dethrone-google-maps-enterprise-space?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-newsletter-689225\">for enterprises</a> </li>\n<li>A gig marketplace that’s entered the unicorn club </li>\n<li>Other newsy highlights such as Tencent getting sued and UnaBiz’s expansion to Japan. </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h6 style=\"padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ffffff; background: #1080A8; padding: 3px; line-height: 10px;\">PREMIUM SUMMARY</span></h6>\n<h2>Who are the guys you need to know when you’ve got a place to go?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622703462_map.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-689237\"></p>\n<p>Having precise location data is critical for many of the services that, as end consumers, we often take for granted, such as food and parcel deliveries or ride-hailing.

It’s addressing a gap left by services like Google Maps, which are consumer-focused and often US-centric. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Wisdom of the crowd</strong>: Part of NextbillionMaps’ value proposition lies in its ability to handle the messy and informal addresses that are common in emerging markets. To do so, it leverages OpenStreetMaps, an open-sourced alternative to Google Maps, and applies artificial intelligence to satellite and street imagery to get its data. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/nextbillionai-dethrone-google-maps-enterprise-space?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-newsletter-689225\">NextBillion.ai looks to dethrone Google Maps in the enterprise space</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h6 style=\"padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ffffff; background: #1080A8; padding: 3px; line-height: 10px;\">PREMIUM SUMMARY</span></h6>\n<h2>Welcome to the unicorn club!</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/india-unicorn.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-670589\"></p>\n<p>Indian gig marketplace Urban Company announced that it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indian-gig-marketplace-urban-company-raises-255m-enters-unicorn-club?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-newsletter-689225\">has secured US$255 million</a> in its latest round of funding at a valuation of US$2.1 billion, making it the latest addition to the country’s stable of unicorns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Founded in 2014</strong>, Urban Company helps customers book reliable home services.

    "status": "publish",
    "slug": "pandemic-tech-talent-relocation-changed",
    "link": "https://www.techinasia.com/pandemic-tech-talent-relocation-changed",
    "content": "<p>Like everything else in our lives, the relocation job market has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Companies usually tend to recruit from abroad when they are unable to find the right talent locally, but the pandemic has forced many businesses, including those located in the Asia-Pacific region, to put their international hiring plans on hold. Measures in place to combat the illness, such as complete lockdowns and restrictions on the entry of foreigners, are some of the reasons.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has also greatly affected startups like our firm <a href=\"https://relocate.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Relocate.me</a>, which aims to help employers attract talent from beyond their borders. In spring 2020, most companies froze all their hiring activities, so job posting subscriptions also ceased. The market only started to revive last September.</p>\n<h2>The current state of affairs</h2>\n<p>Some countries in the region have already begun to ease entry restrictions for foreign nationals because of a shortfall in skilled workers. In Australia, for instance, 17 occupations <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/information-technology/blog/software-developers-programmers-exempted-immigration-ban&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1622612089049000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3itiDmbB7r54DXucxTM52u\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">were exempted</a> from the immigration ban, with software engineers and developers/programmers among them.</p>\n<p>In Singapore, companies <a href=\"https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/how-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">can request</a> entry approval from the Ministry of Manpower to bring their foreign hires and work pass holders into the country. That said, the demand for international talent from employers still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels, but the number of businesses unfreezing international recruiting is steadily growing. Here’s a small selection of the Asia Pacific-based tech companies that are actively hiring foreign talent right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Australia: Linktree, Canva, and Airtasker</li>\n<li>Japan: Mercari, SmartNews, PayPay, Line, Hengge, and Pretia Technologies</li>\n<li>Singapore: ByteDance, BandLab, and Ninja Van</li>\n<li>Thailand: Agoda and Seven Peaks Software</li>\n<li>Malaysia: iPrice Group</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite the rise of remote work and ongoing lockdowns, job seekers’ interest in gaining new work experiences abroad has also started to bounce back.</p>\n<h2>Relocation destination choices</h2>\n<p>According to our data, Australia leads the list of Asia Pacific’s most desirable tech job relocation destinations, with every second international job seeker considering it as a work abroad location. The country consistently ranks as one of the best places in the world to live and work, so this isn’t much of a surprise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-688915\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622608635_Job-relocation-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"></p>\n<p>With 3,162 votes out of 7,000, New Zealand is a close second, followed by Singapore in third place.</p>\n<p>The combination of an excellent quality of life, world-class infrastructure, a massive number of <a href=\"https://vulcanpost.com/718998/which-tech-firm-to-work-for-singapore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">promising startups and leading technology companies</a>, low personal income tax rates, and a very high English language proficiency level make Singapore attractive for foreign techies.</p>\n<p>The list has remained exactly the same since the beginning of 2019, with only some internal shuffling.</p>\n<h2>The countries people are looking to leave</h2>\n<p>Among the locations that tech workers are looking to move out of in 2021, India takes the top spot on the list for the fourth year in a row. The current pandemic situation in the country and its population size are probable factors.</p>\n<p>According to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/desa/international-migration-2020-highlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">United Nations International Migration Report</a>, 18 million Indians live outside of their country of birth. Among non-Asian countries, Nigeria (756), Russia (734), Brazil (387), Argentina (339), and the US (315) have the most significant number of international job seekers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-688916\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622608653_Job-relocation-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"></p>\n<h2>Changes in cross-border recruitment</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The transition from on-site to remote interviews</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The pandemic has significantly changed the hiring process, especially the interview process. Just a year and a half ago, most final interviews with foreign candidates were on-site. Today, the interviewing process is entirely remote. A recent poll we ran showed that most international job seekers, over 70%, of the 850+ respondents were also ready to accept a tech job abroad without having an on-site interview.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remote start</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Typically, companies wait until their new hires have received a work visa and only then start working with them after their relocation. Now, a new employee might begin working remotely, with the opportunity to relocate later while simultaneously completing the paperwork. That’s a definite upside not only for job searchers but also for employers, who can put the newly hired employees through their paces before aiding in their move.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In-office and work-from-home days</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Working from home has become the norm for office jobs. However, companies like IBM, for example, still want to see their employees work in the office X days a week. Building and maintaining an excellent company culture is easier when all team members are together in one place. It will be interesting to see what office life will look like after the pandemic is over.</p>",

    "content": "<p>When it comes to establishing thought leadership for your tech company, you may want to show off your technical know-how and the intricacies of your product using buzzwords and jargon-laden content. But hot take: Nobody really cares. *Oop*</p>\n<p>If you truly want to impress and engage with your audience, it’s not enough to just quote numbers from your extensive research.</p>\n<p>Here are three tips to keep in mind for your thought leadership strategy.</p>\n<h2>1. Cut the buzzwords and jargon</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <em>“Our SaaS solution, which utilizes IoT, AI, and ML, will revolutionize your product and increase your customer LTV dramatically…”</em>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>When non-technical people read stuff like this, their brains shut down and lose interest. Business people use business language, and the hard data of your cutting-edge technology is hardly convincing to people beyond chief information officers.</p>\n<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that you should leave out the technical specifics of your product altogether.</p>\n<p>If your technological innovation is one of your key selling points, explaining it in layman’s terms can be more powerful and effective.</p>\n<p>Apple is a great example here. Instead of parading the iPhone 12’s “300 pixels per inch OLED screen that works without a backlight,” it simply says “OLED delivers brighter brights, darker blacks, and higher resolution for everything you look at.”</p>\n<p>Which line are you more convinced by?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-689047 size-full\" style=\"border: 3px solid #eeeeee; padding: 3px;\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622627539_Screenshot-2021-06-02-at-2.54.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1096\" height=\"1404\"></p>\n<h2>2. Focus on useful content and business outcomes</h2>\n<p>Often, it’s better to go back to basics and answer the most fundamental business question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “How can you help me?”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Does your product help your customers save money? Work more efficiently? Or accelerate their growth? Talk about what business outcome you can achieve and tailor your proposition to your target audience’s pain points.</p>\n<p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who exactly is my target audience? What are their agenda, pain points, and expectations?</li>\n<li>What questions are they struggling to answer?</li>\n<li>What features matter most to them?</li>\n<li>How can I present my content in a creative and engaging way?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, human resources solutions company HReasily worked with <em>Tech in Asia</em> to create a series of useful and timely content for HR professionals in Southeast Asian tech startups.</p>\n<p>Through a comprehensive survey and data-driven research, they were able to provide <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tech-asias-hr-tech-2020-survey\">meaningful insights and answers</a> to many burning questions surrounding culture-building at work, employment benefits, and online HR tools.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689152\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<a href=\"http://techinasia.com/advertise?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=studios-inbound\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689152\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-679833\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622688598_TIA-X-HReasily.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1173\" height=\"682\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-689152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Branded content Tech in Asia created for HReasily.

Show, don’t tell</h2>\n<p>Master the art of storytelling and you’ll keep your customers for a long time.</p>\n<p>When it comes to thought leadership, real-life case studies are key. When you show rather than tell the power of your product, you make your audience part of the experience and help them come to the conclusions that you want. Perhaps that’s why storytelling is one of the most powerful tools in persuasion!</p>\n<p>For example, Southeast Asian ecommerce and gaming giant Sea Group worked with <em>Tech in Asia</em> on a series of behind-the-scenes content that cast light on its people and innovative ideas.</p>\n<p>From how the company was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-helps-sellers-adapt-era-ecommerce\">supporting sellers amid the pandemic</a> to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/learned-shopees-garenas-user-engagement-game\">real stories about its user engagement games</a>, we used the power of storytelling to humanize Sea Group and position it as a thought leader in the regional ecommerce and gaming space.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689153\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<a href=\"http://techinasia.com/advertise?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=studios-inbound\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689153\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-679833\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622688611_TIA-X-SeaGroup.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1173\" height=\"682\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-689153\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Branded content Tech in Asia created for Sea Group. View case studies <a href=\"http://techinasia.com/advertise?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=studios-inbound\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Simply put, effective thought leadership involves thinking differently and presenting your innovative ideas in an understandable and engaging way. In the tech industry, it’s easy to get carried away with jargon-filled sentences which may ostracize people from non-technical roles. Instead, it’s important to truly understand your audience, speak their language, and add value to the conversation.</p>\n<p>If your organization wants to reach the tech and startup community in Southeast Asia, <em>Tech in Asia</em> has the storytelling tools and loyal audience base to help you reach your goals.

MoneySmart was not profitable in both periods in the preceding year.</p>\n<p>After raising significant venture capital in 2017, the company registered growing revenue and losses for three straight years. “About S$4.4 million (US$3.3 million) of costs in 2019 were due to a write-off and restructuring we did,” Nair explains. It had sold its Indonesian business to Lifepal and exited the market that year.</p>\n<p>Since then, operating losses – measured in EBIT – have declined substantially. The firm expects them to shrink further to -S$490,000 (-US$370,000) in 2021 as it dials down on “strategic projects in insurance” to drive long-term growth.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6307414/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%!; margin-top: 4px!important; text-align: right!important;\"></div>\n<p>The firm is now tracking an annualized revenue run rate of S$32 million (US$24.2 million). Between 2019 and 2020, MoneySmart’s revenue grew 23% year on year – a “modest” increase as a result of the pandemic, Nair says.</p>\n<p>Still, this could be considered a decent showing considering the challenging year financial aggregator sites have had.</p>\n<p>In January, GoBear, a competitor platform, announced <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gobears-surprising-sudden-closure\">a sudden closure</a> amid a sharp decrease in demand for financial products, mounting costs, and a failure to raise additional capital. It has since been <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/australias-fintech-firm-finder-acquires-gobear-part-global-expansion\">acquired</a> by Australian fintech platform Finder.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" src=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/6306426/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%!; margin-top: 4px!important; text-align: right!important;\"><a class=\"flourish-credit\" style=\"text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6306426/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/6306426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img style=\"width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important; border: none!important; margin: 0!important;\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg\" alt=\"Made with Flourish\"></a></div>\n<p>Nair attributes MoneySmart’s strong showing to the company being “focused.”</p>\n<p>“We had to make very tough trade-offs [and decide that] we were not going to focus on developing some of the smaller verticals to double down on the ones we thought could work. And thankfully, it paid off,” he says.</p>\n<p>As demand for travel insurance took a dive, MoneySmart doubled down on products such as credit cards and personal loans – now its two largest referral categories, followed by mortgages and online brokerages, in that order.</p>\n<p>The strategy paid off: Between Q4 2020 and the same period the previous year, revenue grew by 70%, more than making up for the shortfall experienced in travel insurance.</p>\n<p>Growth was also a result of being able to successfully entice customers through attractive deals on the platform, Nair says. “We were able to work very closely with our bank partners to offer best-in-market deals.” These included offering AirPods Pro and Apple Watch promotions for credit card sign-ups, co-funded by MoneySmart and its partnering banks. “That really worked well to drive customer growth during a challenging time,” he says.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">It is possible to get to scale and to not burn through cash.</blockquote>\n<p>As banks – which traditionally rely on its branches and roadshows as key customer touchpoints – struggled to adjust to a pure-digital sales channel, platforms like MoneySmart appear to have grown in prominence.</p>\n<p>“The swing from offline to online went in our favor, so that was a fortunate outcome for us,” Nair adds.</p>\n<p>While the firm is present in four markets, including the Philippines and Taiwan, its “main monetizing markets” are Singapore and Hong Kong, he says. Singapore is presently its largest market, contributing 75% of total revenue, though he expects the two cities to become “on par” by 2022.</p>\n<p>Not all has been smooth sailing, however.</p>\n<h2>Company-wide pay cut</h2>\n<p>With countries closing borders and cities worldwide implementing lockdowns, travel insurance – a core revenue pillar for most financial aggregator sites – has dried up.</p>\n<p>In the thick of the pandemic last year, MoneySmart implemented progressive salary cuts across its 120-strong team, with the highest earners taking the biggest cuts. These were partially restored in the fourth quarter of last year and have been fully reinstated as of April.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689012\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689012\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-689012\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622624543_MoneySmart-Group.jpg\" alt=\"MoneySmart Group\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-689012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The MoneySmart team / Photo credit: MoneySmart</p>\n</div>\n<p>“We implemented a six-month performance-based restoration period [such that] if our gross profit hits a certain threshold, we’d restore the corresponding level of salary,” Nair explains. Starting in June, “increments are getting put in place,” he adds.</p>\n<p>An upcoming focus in the second half of the year, the CEO says, will be expanding its product and service offerings in insurance.</p>\n<p>“One of the major trends that we’ve seen is that consumers are more comfortable buying insurance through digital means,” he says. “We think this is going to be the start of a big shift.”</p>\n<p>As travel gradually resumes, Nair expects travel insurance to come back “way stronger than ever,” with customers becoming increasingly risk-averse. Still, a World Tourism Organization <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/tourism-industry-covid19-recovery-government-response/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">survey</a> finds that most travel experts do not expect a full recovery until 2023 at the earliest.</p>\n<p>MoneySmart will also be working more closely with banks to develop better financial products. “If I can secure a lower interest rate through MoneySmart to offer our customers, then it’s not just about the incentive you get – you actually get a better financial product, and banks become increasingly open to such tie-ups and partnerships with us,” he says.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, “it is possible to get to scale and to not burn through cash” despite a challenging past year, Nair says.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars to US dollars: US$1 = S$1.32.</em></p>",

This also is Kleiner Perkins’ first investment in a Pakistani startup.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_689143\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-689143\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-689143\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622685034_Tajir-App.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-689143\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Tajir</p>\n</div>\n<p>Founded in 2019, Tajir is a marketplace that can help owners of mom and pop stores or <em>kiranas</em> source and buy inventory from manufacturers and wholesalers. Tajir users can also get the products delivered to their shops by the next day.</p>\n<p>Last year, Tajir’s product was used by <a href=\"https://www.tajir.app/blog/empowering-mom-and-pop-stores-to-grow-their-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">more than 15,000 <em>kiranas</em></a> in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>The company was founded by siblings Ismail and Babar Khan. Because their father worked in retail distribution for fast-moving consumer goods, they learned the inefficiencies of Pakistan’s wholesale trade at young age. The brothers say that this problem still exists today, and that’s why they built Tajir.</p>\n<p>It became the first Pakistani startup to join YC, and then it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/yc-backed-tajir-raises-1-8m-to-help-mom-and-pop-stores-source-inventory-in-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a US$1.8 million seed round</a> from VentureSouq, Golden Gate Ventures, Fatima Gobi Ventures, and other investors last year.
